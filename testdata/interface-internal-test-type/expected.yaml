    # The bug is that our tool incorrectly reports this as unused:
    # - github.com/715d/unusedfunc/testdata/interface-internal-test-type/internal/hscan.*TimeRFC3339Nano.ScanRedis
    #
    # This method SHOULD NOT be reported as unused because:
    # 1. It implements the Scanner interface
    # 2. The interface is used via reflection type assertion in production code (scanner.go)
    # 3. Even though the test doesn't directly call ScanValue with this type,
    #    the type implements an interface that IS used in production
    #
    # This test WILL FAIL until we fix the bug in RTA's handleTypeAssert
    # The failure will show: "unexpected unused function" for TimeRFC3339Nano.ScanRedis
