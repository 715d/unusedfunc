# Test case: Exported methods in library packages should be entry points
# 
# Expected behavior:
# - PublicMethod (exported method) should be an entry point
# - privateHelper (called by PublicMethod) should NOT be reported as unused
# - unusedPrivateMethod (never called) SHOULD be reported as unused
# - PublicFunction (exported function) should be an entry point  
# - helperFunction (called by PublicFunction) should NOT be reported as unused
# - unusedFunction (never called) SHOULD be reported as unused
