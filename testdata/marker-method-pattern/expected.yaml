    # NOTE: The marker() methods should NOT be reported as unused:
    # - NotFoundError.marker
    # - ValidationError.marker
    # - PermissionError.marker
    #
    # These methods are never called directly, but they are essential for
    # implementing the AppError interface. They enable type discrimination
    # via errors.As(), which uses reflection to check interface satisfaction.
    # Removing them would break interface contracts.
