# Context Files

This directory is for temporary working notes and session summaries during development.

## File Naming Convention

When creating new context files during development:

Format: `YYYYMMDD-topic-description.md`

Examples:
- `20250831-rta-callgraph-analysis.md`
- `20251106-performance-investigation.md`

## Maintenance Policy

**Create context files** when:
- Working on complex investigations or bugs
- Documenting performance analysis sessions
- Capturing temporary findings during development

**Delete context files** when:
- Findings are consolidated into main documentation
- Investigation is complete and decision is made
- Information becomes historical (git preserves it)

Main documentation structure:
- `docs/architecture.md` - Design decisions and patterns
- `docs/workflows.md` - Commands and procedures
- `docs/reference/` - External API docs and references
